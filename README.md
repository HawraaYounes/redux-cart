# Redux Cart

## Overview

This project is a simple cart application built using ReactJS and Redux with Redux Toolkit. The main objective of this app is to demonstrate effective state management in a React application, showcasing the power of Redux for handling complex state interactions. It highlights my skills in state management, action creators, and asynchronous data fetching.

## Features

- **Redux Management**:
  - **State Management**: Utilizing Redux for managing the global state in a predictable manner.
  - **Slices**: Creating slices for each reducer using Redux Toolkit to organize state management:
    - **Cart Slice**: Manages cart state, including adding, removing, and updating items.
    - **Ui Slice**: Handles ui changes like toggling cart components or showing app notifications.
  - **Action Creators**: Creating action creators for handling side effects and async operations.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Add Item**: Add items to the cart through a user interface.
  - **Remove Item**: Remove items from the cart.
  - **Update Quantity**: Adjust item quantities in the cart.
  - **Notification**: Display notifications for errors or successful data fetching.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - **ReactJS**: Used for building the frontend components and managing state.
  - **Redux**: Implemented for state management across the application.
  - **Redux Toolkit**: Used for simplifying Redux setup and management, including creating slices.
